This directory contains FASTA files derived from Salmonella reference genomes. Only the 1st 10,000 bases of each reference was taken, however since they all have the same start sites (dnaA) they contain some overlapping material.
They are a varitey of serovars. The S. Typhimurium samples would be expected to cluster near each other. Similarly the S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A would be expected to cluster together. S. Weltevreden is an outgroup and should not be close to any of the other serovars.
