abstract = {Mash extends the MinHash dimensionality-reduction technique to include a pairwise mutation distance and P value significance test, enabling the efficient clustering and search of massive sequence collections. Mash reduces large sequences and sequence sets to small, representative sketches, from which global mutation distances can be rapidly estimated. We demonstrate several use cases, including the clustering of all 54,118 NCBI RefSeq genomes in 33 CPU h; real-time database search using assembled or unassembled Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore data; and the scalable clustering of hundreds of metagenomic samples by composition.

@article{Wood2014,
abstract = {Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed for this task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program. In its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of over 4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11 times faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken is available at http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/.},

@article{Sokal1958,
abstract = {Starting with correlation coefficients (based on numerous characters) among species of a systematic unit, the authors developed a method for grouping species, and regrouping the resultant assemblages, to form a classifactory hierarchy most easily expressed as a treelike diagram of relationships. The details of this method are described, using as an example a group of bees. The resulting classification was similar to that previously established by classical systematic methods, although some taxonomic changes were made in view of the new light thrown on relationships. The method is time consuming, although practical in isolated cases, with punched-card machines such as were used; it becomes generally practical with increasingly widely available digital computers.},
